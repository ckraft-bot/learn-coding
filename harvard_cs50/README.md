Following along the [Harvard CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python – Full University Course](https://youtu.be/nLRL_NcnK-4) on [freeCodeCamp.org chaneel](https://www.youtube.com/@freecodecamp). 

As a self-taught programmer I did not learn the proper terminologies like variables, arguments, parameters, statements, functions and so on. So I'm watching this youtube video to learn the labels to actions. Hope this help you!
