# PythonForKids
I went through all the chapter of the "Python for Kids" ebook to master the basics. Even thought the book title is "Python for Kids" I think it's a great resource for any beginner. 

# LearnPython
I have learned python in an unstructured manner. Then i spent several months dabbing in python for data science with the "IBM Data Science Professional Certificate" program (https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science?utm_source=gg&amp;utm_medium=sem&amp;campaignid=1876641588&amp;utm_campaign=10-IBM-Data-Science-US&amp;utm_content=B2C&amp;adgroupid=70740725700&amp;device=c&amp;keyword=ibm%20data%20science&amp;matchtype=b&amp;network=g&amp;devicemodel=&amp;adpostion=&amp;creativeid=347445112274&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwtIaVBhBkEiwAsr7-c-ZQJ6m5d6gzGFtKOovls7N4fDXwX-sJcmMKFMCqNbAfO4R-rbYarBoCpBIQAvD_BwE). Outside of that I did go thorugh the "Python for Kids" book on my own. That took just a few hours.  Now i hope to learn python in an orderly fasion. I'll be resorting to youtube for these structured instructions (https://youtu.be/rfscVS0vtbw).  The instruction of choice is Free Code Camp's "Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]"

# LearnPython2
Continuing my structured self-learning, I'll be following this curriculum for intermediate python with NeuralNine at: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7yh-TELLS1F3KytMVZRFO-xIo_S2_Jg1.

# Python Basic Datatypes

This [tutorial](https://youtu.be/kvyT2x7JMps?si=aRzPyizXYonUjFTD) covers the basic data types in Python programming language, including integers, floating numbers, strings, booleans, lists, and so on. The tutorial comes with a [Jupyter notebook](python_datatypes_template.ipynb) which you can downlaod and code along. The coded out [notebook](python_datatypes_solution.ipynb) is also available

__Prerequisites & Usuage__
 
To follow along with this tutorial, you should have a basic understanding of Python programming language and access to Jupyter notebook. You will need to have Python 3.x installed on your computer.
